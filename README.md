## 🚨 Problem We Solve

Every year, thousands of lives are lost in India due to the unavailability of blood at the right moment. Reasons include:

- Rare blood groups  
- Lack of blood banks in rural/village areas  
- Emergencies where hospitals or banks can't help fast enough  

**Rakt-Setu** acts as a digital bridge between patients and donors, ensuring real-time access to critical help.
